<div class="about-text">
<p class="drop-cap">My name is Trent Maziarz and I am a PhD student working at the intersection of <strong>digital history</strong> and <strong>computer science</strong>. My research explores how computational methods — network analysis, natural language processing, data visualization — can help us ask new questions of historical sources and illuminate patterns that traditional methods alone cannot reveal.</p>

<p>I am drawn to this work because historical sources are messy, incomplete, and deeply human — exactly the kind of data that demands both computational rigor and interpretive sensitivity. I build tools and frameworks that try to honor both, creating bridges between the humanities and computer science that serve scholars across disciplines.</p>
