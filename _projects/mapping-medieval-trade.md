An interactive geospatial visualization of trade routes across 14th-century Europe, built with D3.js and archival customs records.

This project draws on customs ledgers from major trading cities to reconstruct the flow of goods across medieval Europe. Using network analysis and geographic visualization, it reveals patterns of exchange that traditional cartographic methods obscure.
